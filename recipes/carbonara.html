        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are two types of carbonara pasta depending on where you're from, but most people tend to think about the red marinara sauce filled deliciousness. The thing is this is the American version or fusion of the Italian classic carbonara. So today, lets learn how to make the classic Carbonara alla Italiana.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>350g of spaghetti</li>
            <li>200g of pancetta</li>
            <li>4 whole eggs</li>
            <li>100g of grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, boil water while you prepare the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cut the pancetta into small pieces or cubes then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes. Stirring occasionally so it doesn't burn. You don't need oil for this as the pancetta's fat will melt fabulously on its own.</li>
            <li>Now prepare the pecorino cream. In a bowl, put the eggs and cheese, add some pepper and mix quickly with a fork until you have a creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook depending on the box.</li>
            <li>Now, using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready then place in the skillet over high heat to season well with the pancetta.</li>
            <li>When the spaghetti and pancetta start sizzling turn off the heat, otherwise you will cook the eggs. Now, quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta and stir. The consistency should be creamy, but not runny.</li>
            <li>Once its ready to serve, create a pasta nest and place it on the plate then add the pancetta with some pepper and voila!</li>
