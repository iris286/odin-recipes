            <li>Add the canned tomatoes with a pinch of salt and simmer for 10 minutes while breaking up the tomatoes enough so they bust open.</li>
            <li>Once simmered, add some mozzarella and basil and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Now, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the gnocchi until they float to the surface.</li>
            <li>Remove the gnocchi and add to the tomatoes sauce, toss to coat.</li>
            <li>If your pan isn't ove-proof then transfer the gnocchi to an oven-proof baking dish.</li>
            <li>To bake, top the gnocchi with more mozzarella and bake for 20 minutes until the mozzarella is melted, bubbling and golden. And then you're done!</li>
